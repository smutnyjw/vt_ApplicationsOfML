# vt_ApplicationsOfML
 Homework, Projects, and Libraries associated with the Virginia Tech grad school course ECE-5984 ApplicationsOfMachineLearning instructed by Dr Creed Jones. January 2022 to May 2022.

Topics Discussed
1) Review: Linear Algebra & Statistics
2) Data Exploration, Missing Values, Normalization (Classification vs Regression) and Data Preparation (imputation)
3) Variable Selection (Forward, Backword, Step-wise)
4) Performance Evauation for Classification & Regression models
5) Model Selection

6) Decision Trees (Entropy, Gini Tree, and Random Forest (Ensemble Bootstrap))
7) k Nearest Neighbor (Similarity distance models)
8) Bayesian Prediction (Probaility based learning through Bayes' Theorem and Conditional Probability)
9) Multivariate Linear Regression (Gradient based learning - First Order (linear))
10) Logistic Regression
11) Artifical Neural Networks (many architectures)
12) Preview: Deep Learning, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning
